# Practice
The Practice Grounds
// This is the natural home of all practices heretofore of the CrystalizedDreamer and his works therein
// I desire to shift careers into something that is a bit more natural to me, something more cerebral, this diary shall chronicle the charge.
// As far as I am able, I shall do my very best to copy my practices into this place so that others may see them.
// Therefore, if you are a n00b wanting to watch another total n00b learn to code like the rest, follow along,
// if you are a veteran here to watch a total scrub attempt to join your ranks and fall on his face miserably a few times
// note, I am staking my entire future on my ability to quickly and cleanly absorb all of the information I am about to attempt.
// Wish me luck, -CD
