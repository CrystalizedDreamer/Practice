CODECADEMY WEBSITE PROJECT COMPLETED

Notes for today
I need to train myself on cleaning up the alignment of my code. I've detected that it works fairly well, but I'd better learn better organising conventions if I'm going to work well with others in the future.
I have no desire to be an inconvenience or nuissance during my work.
