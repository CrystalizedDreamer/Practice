LOG INITIATION
Today I am learning more deeply into CSS and how it integrates to HTML
so far I have learned about the box method of organization regarding margins, padding and borders as they pertain to elements on a page
margin and padding are measured in pixels and the flow is from the top in a clockwise motion.
