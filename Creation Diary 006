LOG INITIATION
Today I am learning more deeply into CSS and how it integrates to HTML
so far I have learned about the box method of organization regarding margins, padding and borders as they pertain to elements on a page
margin and padding are measured in pixels and the flow is from the top in a clockwise motion.

I will need to revisit positionings in css because for some reason, the concept does not appear to be retaining itself as readily as I would have hoped.

Z index governs the positioning relative to the viewer, as a stack.
NOTE: I think that I need to re-visit this day in the future.

Area of improvement needed, retrain focus on CSS Positioning in a returning module.
Static vs Absolute vs fixed, as in the english lexicon these all mean the same thing, but in programming they do not.

display controls the block level of an element.

fixed removes an elemenmt from the flow of html and holds it to a position
static is the default of defaults, thus it ignores Z index
Relative is relative to static position
Fixed is in relation to the user's view
Inlines do not start new lines.

It occurs to me that I have come close to my first Exams, I'm a bit nervous but something tells me I'm ready to tackle these issues.

INTERNAL NOTE 
Return to the VSCODE entry module on CodeCademy
Return to Active Code Reviews during daylight hours for additional practice in collaborative efforts.
Return to the Chrome Devtools Module during Creation Diary 7 or 8 in order to learn more about this additional code environment.

The next project requires local development from my personal computer. For tonight I will terminate the journal and realign myself to complete the next module in the morning.
