I have returned after a brief hiatus to my studies, now that this is settled. I hope to continue progress going forward and will be referring to my notes to recover any lost ground
With that said, off I go. 

For today's work, I'm going to tackle another Codecademy sample project, but this time it will be done off platform without assistance for html and CSS. wish me luck
