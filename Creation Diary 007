I have returned after a brief hiatus to my studies, now that this is settled. I hope to continue progress going forward and will be referring to my notes to recover any lost ground
With that said, off I go. 

For today's work, I'm going to tackle another Codecademy sample project, but this time it will be done off platform without assistance for html and CSS. wish me luck
AHHH while working my project I realized that the CSS file MUST be in the same folder as the HTML file in order for it to work.
Therefore, it stands to reason that common practice should be that only media and external additives to a website should be in the resource folder
I will need to confirm this in the wider industry
