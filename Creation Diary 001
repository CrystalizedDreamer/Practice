// Creation Diary 001 
// Day 1 - 02-12-2024

// Discovery of note
// In Codecademy's practice areas I have noticed that tags are only accepted in lowercase format. It is unknown as to whether or not this is due to a particular industry convention or otherwise
// Nevertheless, I shall have to follow this to the best of my abilities. If anybody reads this diary and has an insight to provide, please comment so that I might have clarity.
// Note: CodeCademy will only accept one verification of code at a time, so sometimes you will wonder if you did it correctly but you might've.

//I have to wonder if the tables will adjust to the number of data points provided or if this is a constraint that CodeCademy automatically accounts for.
// Update, I think that you have to manually keep track of the number of columns and rows are there
//
// Terminate Log. Good night to all
