Good Morning all.

This marks day 5 of my journey to learn coding and programming and all I can say out the gate today is it feels like I'm doing something I always should've been doing.
I'm proud of the progress I'm making so far, and I think that I feel at home working on these things. I'm starting to get a general idea of how these actions would apply to the working world too.
I suppose there really isn't much more to say.
