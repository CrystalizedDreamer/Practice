// Good Morning to all.
// Today is Valentine's day, but this has not stopped my progress. My boyfriend sits to my right, Black tea is to my left, and I'm filled with DETERMINATION *ahem*
//
// My first thoughts of the day, are that though I begin this work I hope that I can measure up to any and all expectations set upon me by myself and others.
// Other than that, no other thoughts are particularly present in my mind. With all that said, time to begin.

//PRACTICE INITIATION\\

//Practice Project 'Wine Schedule' completed, Project to be exported before day's end.

Additional thoughts that occur to me are that HTML is a very straightforward and simple language to grasp as once the fundamentals are understood, the rest is fairly self explanatory.
This thought occurred to me while I was learning forms. For example, in the input tag (the tag that governs the input box of a form) I wanted to do that gray disappearing text in my form.
In the past, I had heard of this  text referred to as placeholder text in forums. So, I took a whack at it, thinking it couldn't be that straightforward. but to my surprise... it was exactly that.
I don't think this makes me particularly smart or clever to make this inference.
I just found it a bit surprising.

oh, I think that I may be pushing myself a bit hard and fast. I'm feeling a bit foggy but I can't begin to guess why.

RESPITE INITIATED
