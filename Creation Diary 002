// Good Morning to everybody here.

// This marks the beginning of the second day of my journey.
// Already, I find myself pondering a screenname change, based on how seriously some seem to take their screenname as an identifier to their online work.
/CrystalizedDreamer is a fun little title I guess, but I do wonder if it fits me the way I'd like.
// I know it's childish, but part of me would love to choose a name that references Nintendo's Pikmin series. It has always felt like home to me...
// At any rate, gadding about in this diary is not going to assist me in my growth, so I am going to begin my work for today and report my thoughts as I go.

// Finishing up the foundations course, it occurs to me this time that unlike all the others, this is finally something I have chosen outright and have removed all roadblocks for
//proverbially one could say that my back is against the wall, but that isn't necessarily true. I placed myself headlong into this position. This was my decision.
// I have learned in a few short excercises that code is temperamental and the syntax should be followed very precisely as to avoid a break in the code. A single comma set me back at least 5 minutes

// I think that during projects of all sorts I should create small note sections to explain the workings and thought processes I follow in the production of my work
// this will ensure a clean workflow as well as highlight necessary considerations at determined points of interest,
// it will also ensure that I maintain an accessible workflow that will lend itself to collaborations in my presence and in my absence.

// I have noticed that the excercise that I am working on presently in Code Foundations is a Python script. It appears that Python is very well tooled to handle the data sciences. 
// on the flip side though, I should have remained on the HTML course through its completion to avoid unnecessary splintering of my attentions and efforts.
// After all, I am orchestrating a career change, and thus deviations from the most expedient path should be minimized

//Whenever possible, if you are creating a program that will be used repeatedly for measuring the exact same variables, it would be wise to construct the program in such a manner
//that all that needs to be done is to plug in the updated variables rather than running the entire program again. This will likely save hours of effort.
//it will also aid in the preservation of one's sanity, to be sure...

// CODE FOUNDATIONS CERTIFICATION ACHIEVED //
// HTML5 LEARNING RE-INITIATED//

// Due to the ammount of time that has passed since my last learning, I have decided it would be most beneficial to restart my learning of HTML5 in case my knowledge base has declined
//HTML5 Module 1 Complete. Estimation: 13% Completion
//A Browser needs to know what language we are working with, thus each document requires a document declaration, such as <!DOCTYPE html> and though it may seem self explanatory, save these files as html files.

//HTML5 Module 2 Complete Estimation 26% Completion

//HTML5 Module 3 Complete Estimation 46% HTML5 Completion

//Log Terminated
