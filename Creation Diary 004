Good Morning all

I've had a bit of a late start today but I suppose that is of little actual consequence.
Today, I finished learning the HTML5 Basics!
//HTML5 CERTIFICATE ACHIEVED!!!//

With the foundations of HTML learned, it is time to resume the main course of becoming a Front End Engineer, I know a lot will go into it,
but I am confident thus far in my ability to catch up to the task at hand.

The first thing brought to my attention was the idea to make contact with or be aware of the Mozilla Development Network,
as one of the internet's bastions of technological knowledge in development.

//FRONT END DEVELOPER PATH AT 10%//

phew... 10% is... rather daunting, but something tells me I can do this. I'm having the time of my life learning all of this.

CSS Learning Initiated, Relevant Documents will be posted to relevant Branch
